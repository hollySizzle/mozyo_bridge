"""Built-in herdr CLI terminal-transport adapter (Redmine #13245).

The core seam
(:mod:`mozyo_bridge.e_140_adapter_provider.f_130_terminal_runtime_provider.domain.terminal_transport`)
defines the fail-closed :class:`TerminalTransportPort` and the default-off
backend selection. This module is the single concrete, built-in provider that
fills it: a subprocess wrapper over the **herdr CLI**. Core still owns the
send-safety contract, the result / reason vocabulary, and the target guard; this
module only performs the provider-owned mechanics, so the dependency points
provider -> core.

Why the CLI and not the socket protocol
---------------------------------------
The #13175 PoC (``vibes/docs/logics/herdr-poc-13175-experiment-log.md``) proved
the transport round-trip two ways: the herdr **CLI** (``pane send-text`` /
``pane send-keys`` / ``agent read``, experiments E8 / E11) and the raw Unix-domain
**socket JSON protocol** underneath it. This adapter deliberately targets the
**CLI**: it is the documented, stable surface, whereas the socket wire protocol
is an *internal, unpublished* herdr detail (E2 catalogued the remote/surface
inventory; the socket JSON shapes carry no compatibility promise). Binding to the
CLI keeps the adapter robust across herdr versions and avoids re-implementing an
undocumented protocol — the same "one built-in provider over a stable surface"
posture as the Redmine note transport (#12347) using the documented HTTP API.

Trusted-environment binary boundary
-----------------------------------
The herdr executable path comes **only** from the trusted environment
(:data:`HERDR_BINARY_ENV`), never a repo-local file. Running an arbitrary binary
is a code-execution vector, so — exactly like the delivery-write credentials
(#12347) — the executable a checkout can cause mozyo to spawn is pinned by the
daemon environment, not by ``.mozyo-bridge/config.yaml``. The repo-local config
only *selects* the herdr backend; it can never say *which* binary runs. When
herdr is selected but the binary is unset or unresolvable,
:func:`resolve_terminal_transport` fails closed
(``binary_unconfigured`` / ``binary_not_found``) with **no silent fallback** to
tmux.

Scope (staged seam)
-------------------
These are bare send / read primitives. The PoC learnings that belong to the
*send rail* — clearing a residual composer before injection (E8's stray ``qq``
prefix) and the Codex Enter-resend / check-then-wait turn-start rails (E9 /
E12–E14) — are **not** implemented here; they layer on top in the turn-start US
(#13248). No test in this US runs a live herdr binary: the port contract is
exercised through an in-memory fake, and this adapter is exercised through an
injected subprocess ``runner`` that verifies argv and simulates
success / not-found / non-zero-exit without spawning herdr.
