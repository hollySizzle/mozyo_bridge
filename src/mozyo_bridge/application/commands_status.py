"""status command family — OOP-first session-read + command-handler boundary
(Redmine #12830 / #12825 / #12785 / #12638 / #12749).

#12785 (the first tranche) pulled the ``status`` command's three external
session reads — session existence, window enumeration, and the agent-pane
capture — behind
:class:`~mozyo_bridge.application.status_session_port.StatusSessionPort`, and
moved the present/missing agent-window classification the procedural
``cmd_status`` inlined into :class:`ResolveSessionStatusUseCase`, which returns
a frozen :class:`SessionStatusView` value object.

#12825 (this tranche) carves the remaining ``cmd_status`` orchestration into an
OOP-first command-handler boundary:

* :class:`StatusCommandRequest` — the typed input the handler consumes, so
  ``cmd_status`` no longer threads ``argparse.Namespace`` past
  :func:`resolve_status_session`.
* :func:`render_status_report` — a *pure* presentation function turning the
  :class:`SessionStatusView` and the cockpit-membership projection into the
  exact stdout block (byte-preserving), with no ``print`` side effect.
* :class:`StatusCockpitMembershipPort` / :class:`LiveStatusCockpitMembership` —
  the cockpit-membership projection behind an injectable port so the handler is
  driven by a fake policy, not a ``commands.*`` monkeypatch.
* :class:`StatusReport` — the typed result the handler returns (the rendered
  block); the thin ``cmd_status`` adapter prints it and delegates the doctor
  tail.
* :class:`StatusCommandHandler` — composes the session-read use case, the
  membership port, and the pure renderer into one typed ``handle`` step.

#12830 (this tranche) resolves the ``_status_repo_cockpit_membership`` residual
that #12825 carried in ``commands.py``: the procedural projection body is
decomposed into a typed boundary owned here —

* :class:`CockpitMembershipIdentity` — the value object the projection threads
  from the live identity reads (workspace id + lane) into both the pure match
  policy and the absent-record construction.
* :func:`match_cockpit_membership` — the *pure* domain policy selecting this
  repo's loaded cockpit record by workspace id + normalized lane, unit tested
  with fake workspace records (no live read, no ``commands.*`` monkeypatch).
* :class:`StatusCockpitMembershipReads` / :class:`LiveStatusCockpitMembershipReads`
  — the cockpit reads (identity / membership collection / absent record) behind
  one injectable port; the live adapter routes to the ``commands.*`` cockpit
  helpers *at call time* so the existing cockpit monkeypatch tests are intact.
* :class:`CockpitMembershipProjection` — the tolerant use case composing the
  pure policy over the reads port; ``LiveStatusCockpitMembership`` now wires it
  over the live reads, preserving the ``StatusCockpitMembershipPort`` shape.

#12831 (this tranche) isolates the ``cmd_status`` -> ``cmd_doctor(args)`` tail
delegation that #12830 carried as a #12638 residual. The doctor tail is the
status command's *continuation*: after the status block is rendered, the
command's exit code is the doctor command's. That continuation is now a typed
boundary owned here —

* :class:`StatusContinuationResult` — the value object carrying the doctor
  tail's ``exit_code``, so the status command's exit code is a typed result
  rather than a bare ``int`` threaded out of a free-function call.
* :class:`StatusDoctorContinuation` / :class:`LiveStatusDoctorContinuation` —
  the doctor continuation behind one injectable port; the live adapter owns the
  ``argparse.Namespace`` and routes to ``commands.cmd_doctor`` *at call time*,
  so the existing ``test_cmd_status_*`` integration tests that patch
  ``commands.run_doctor`` / ``commands.format_doctor_text`` still drive the live
  doctor while the status command no longer hands the namespace to a naked
  ``cmd_doctor(args)`` call.
* :class:`StatusCommandHandler` now owns the continuation as a collaborator and
  exposes :meth:`StatusCommandHandler.continue_with_doctor`, so the doctor tail
  is driven by a fake continuation in unit tests instead of monkeypatching the
  ``commands.*`` doctor helpers. The thin ``cmd_status`` adapter renders +
  prints the report, then runs the continuation (preserving the stdout order:
  status block first, doctor output second).

Residual to #12638 (explicitly carried, not resolved here): the broad
``cmd_doctor`` / ``run_doctor`` body still lives in ``commands.py`` /
``doctor.py``; this tranche cuts only the status->doctor continuation boundary,
not the doctor command's own decomposition. Read-only boundary: no send-keys /
paste-buffer routing.
