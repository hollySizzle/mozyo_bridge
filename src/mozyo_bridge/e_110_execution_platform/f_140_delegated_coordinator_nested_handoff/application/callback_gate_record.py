"""Canonical gate-record writer: post a discoverable gate journal to Redmine (#13520 review F1a).

The production **producer wiring** the re-audit required (#13518 j#75381 F1a): before this, the
callback watcher's :func:`...callback_runtime.discover_candidates` read
``[mozyo:workflow-event:...]`` markers that *nothing in production wrote* — only test fixtures
hand-authored them, so scanning a real issue yielded zero candidates. This module closes that
loop: it renders a callback-required gate journal through the single canonical renderer
(:func:`...domain.redmine_journal_source.render_gate_note`, which always embeds the structured
marker) and posts it to Redmine through the same **credential-gated, opt-in** note transport all
durable handoff writes use (``MOZYO_REDMINE_DELIVERY_WRITE``). A real gate recorded this way is
then discoverable end-to-end: producer -> Redmine journal -> live poll -> exact-journal classify
-> outbox -> one-send callback.

Boundaries:

- **opt-in / fail-closed.** With no live transport (the opt-in unset), nothing is written and the
  receipt reason is ``write_optin_unset`` — never a silent success. The transport itself fails
  closed on a missing base URL / credential (``base_url_unset`` / ``credential_missing``) without
  ever carrying a credential.
- **injectable transport.** The write seam is injected; production resolves
  :func:`...redmine_note_transport.redmine_delivery_transport_from_env`, tests inject a fake so the
  full producer -> post -> discover path is verified with no live Redmine.
- **producer is the only marker source.** The note text always comes from ``render_gate_note``; a
  caller never hand-writes the marker, so the discovered gate cannot drift from what was recorded.
