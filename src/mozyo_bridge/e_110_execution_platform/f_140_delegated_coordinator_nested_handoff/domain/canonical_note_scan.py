"""The one quote-aware canonical marker scan every journal-note reader shares (Redmine #14585).

A structured ``[mozyo:<channel>:k=v:...]`` marker is how an agent records a durable decision in a
Redmine journal. A journal that *quotes* that grammar — a review discussing the contract, a callback
record echoing the landing marker it observed, a spec excerpt pasted into a note — is **not** that
agent recording a decision. Reading the two the same way is what let a quoted marker become gate
authority on a fresh lane (#14577 j#90416 F1).

That distinction was implemented once, inside the proxy rail's own reader (#14546
``coordinator_proxy_send.canonical_note_text``), while its sibling — the
:mod:`...domain.redmine_journal_source` reader that ``workflow watch`` / callback discovery / the
``workflow step`` anchor gate all go through — kept scanning the raw note. Two readers of the same
grammar with two different notions of "quoted" is a drift generator, so the rule set now lives here,
stated once, and both readers call it:

- **A. fenced code** — from a ```` ``` ```` / ``~~~`` opener to its closer, fences included. An
  unclosed fence swallows the rest of the note (a half-open quotation is still a quotation).
- **B. blockquote** — ``>`` as the first non-space character, nesting (``> >``) included.
- **C. indented code** — four or more spaces (or a tab) of indent, Markdown's other verbatim block.
- **D. inline code** — a backtick span inside an otherwise canonical line.

Two properties of the scan are load-bearing rather than incidental:

- **Quoted regions are blanked, not deleted.** The line structure survives, so a marker can never be
  spliced together out of fragments that sat on either side of a quotation.
- **The scan is per line.** The marker body grammar is ``[^\\]]*``, which spans newlines, so scanning
  the blanked note as one string would let an unclosed ``[mozyo:`` on one line close on a ``]``
  further down and parse as a marker that no single line contains.

The cost is that a canonical marker must be written at top level and on one line: a marker indented
four spaces under a list bullet, or split across lines, is refused. Both canonical producers
(:func:`...redmine_journal_source.render_gate_note` /
:func:`...redmine_journal_source.render_dispatch_note`) already render at column 0 on one line, and
that direction of failure is recoverable — the writer re-records at column 0. The other direction,
handing authority to a quotation, is not.
